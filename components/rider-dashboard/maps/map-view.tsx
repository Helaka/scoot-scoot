// Since the existing code was left out for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables, and without the original code, it's impossible to provide a meaningful merged code block. To resolve the issues, one would need to examine the original code and either import the necessary variables or declare them within the scope where they are used.

// Example of how to declare variables if they are not imported:
// const the = someValue;
// const existing = someOtherValue;
// const code = anotherValue;
// const was = yetAnotherValue;
// const assumed = aFinalValue;

// Replace the above comments with the actual declarations or imports based on the original code.
