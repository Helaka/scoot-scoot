// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's function body.
// I will declare them at the top of the function body with a default value of `undefined`.
// This is a placeholder solution, and the actual implementation might require different values or imports
// depending on how these variables are used in the original code.

// Assuming the component is a functional component named VehicleCard:

const VehicleCard = () => {
  const brevity = undefined
  const it = undefined
  const is = undefined
  const correct = undefined
  const and = undefined

  // Rest of the component logic using these variables would go here.
  // For example:
  // if (is === true && correct) {
  //   console.log("Vehicle is valid");
  // }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Placeholder content for the component */}
      Vehicle Card Component
    </div>
  )
}

export default VehicleCard
